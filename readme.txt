Free maps and markers. Create private or publicly-editable maps on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you create free anonymous live maps on your website. You can also unlock your maps so that other people can contribute to it.

Need to show all your business locations? Create a private map and mark the spots so that your customers know where to visit you.

You can also create maps that your visitors can contribute to! For example: want to gather your customers favorite restaurants? Create an unlocked and public map for restaurants that anyone can contribute to!

= What is Cartes.io? =

Cartes.io is a platform initially used to report incidents that may be dangerous during times of unrest or protest. Now it allows anyone to create maps and markers for any purpose; inspired by anonymous image hosting sites like Imgur, this is the map equivalent.

1. Create and manage maps and markers right from the admin dashboard.
2. Discover awesome public and interactive maps made by the community.
